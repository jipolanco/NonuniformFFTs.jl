# Approximate kernel function using piecewise polynomials.
# On each subinterval of size 1/M (where M is the integer kernel half-width), we approximate
# the kernel using a polynomial of degree N - 1.
# Note that the piecewise polynomial is allowed (in principle) to be discontinuous between
# two subintervals.
#
# The idea is heavily inspired by FINUFFT (see Barnett, Magland & af Klinteberg, SIAM J.
# Sci. Comput. 2019), with a few small differences:
#
# - we don't need to generate specific code for specific oversampling factors σ or
#   half-widths M. Our implementation is generic and even then it's extremely efficient;
#
# - we interpolate from function values at Chebyshev nodes, instead of evaluating the
#   function in the complex plane. This is inspired by a paper by Shamshigar, Bagge &
#   Tornberg (J. Chem. Phys. 2021).

using StaticArrays: SVector
using LinearAlgebra: lu!, ldiv!

# Note: we could use StaticArrays here but that will greatly increase the compilation time
# (unnecessarily, since this function is called just when creating a plan, and it's quite
# cheap).
