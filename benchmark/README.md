# Performance benchmarks

This directory contains scripts for executing benchmarks (`run_benchmarks.jl`)
and generated plotting results (`plots/plot_benchmarks.jl`).

It also contains raw benchmark results (in `results`) and their associated
plots (`plots/*.svg`) which are discussed in the
[Benchmarks](https://jipolanco.github.io/NonuniformFFTs.jl/dev/benchmarks/)
section of the docs.
