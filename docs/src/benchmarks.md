## Introduction

The benchmarks consist in type-1 and type-2 NUFFTs on a uniform 3D grid of
fixed dimensions $M^3 = 256^3$ (excluding oversampling). We vary the number of
non-uniform points $N$, so that the point density $ρ = N / M^3$ takes values
between $10^{-4}$ (very few points) and $10^1$ (very dense).
Points are randomly located in $[0, 2π)^3$ using a uniform distribution.
The relative tolerance is fixed to $10^{-6}$.
In NonuniformFFTs.jl, this can be achieved with the parameters `σ = 1.5`
(oversampling factor) and `m = HalfSupport(4)` (see [Accuracy](@ref accuracy)).
All tests are run in double precision (`Float64` or `ComplexF64` non-uniform data).

The tests were run on a cluster with an AMD EPYC 7302 CPU (32 threads) and an
NVIDIA A100 GPU.

The benchmarks compare NonuniformFFTs.jl v0.6.7 (26/11/2024) and FINUFFT v2.3.1
(see [FINUFFT set-up](@ref) for details).

Each reported time includes (1) the time spent processing non-uniform points
(`set_points!` / `(cu)finufft_setpts!`) and (2) the time spent on the actual transform (`exec_type{1,2}!` / `(cu)finufft_exec!`).

The script used for benchmarking can be found in [`benchmarks/run_benchmarks.jl`](https://github.com/jipolanco/NonuniformFFTs.jl/blob/master/benchmarks/run_benchmarks.jl).

## [Complex non-uniform data](@id benchmarks-complex)

```@raw html
<p>
Libraries like FINUFFT or NFFT.jl only support complex non-uniform data.
Therefore, these tests provide a direct comparison of the performance of different libraries.
On the CPU (<b>crosses</b>), the performance of the multi-threaded NonuniformFFTs.jl (<span class=NonuniformFFTs>blue</span>) and
FINUFFT (<span class=FINUFFT>orange</span>) implementations is quite comparable over a wide range of problem sizes.

```

On the GPU, we test two different implementations which are heavily inspired by the CuFINUFFT paper [Shih2021](@cite).
The default one (**filled circles**) corresponds to setting
`gpu_method = :global_memory` in [`PlanNUFFT`](@ref).
This method is slightly faster than CuFINUFFT at low point densities, but
slightly slower at large ones.
However, at large densities it is actually faster to use the non-default
`gpu_method = :shared_memory` option (**open circles**, labelled "SM" in the figures).

The `:shared_memory` method performs some operations on GPU [shared
memory](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-shared-memory-cuda-cc/) (also called [local data share](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/understand/hardware_implementation.html#local-data-share)), which is small but much faster than the GPU's global memory.
During spreading (type-1 transforms), this approach allows to reduce the number
of atomic operations performed in global memory.
Our implementation is inspired by the CuFINUFFT one [Shih2021](@cite) with
a few differences.
In particular, we completely avoid atomic operations on shared memory, which
seems to speed up things quite a bit and might explain the important gains
with respect to the CuFINUFFT implementation.[^1]
Another difference is that we also provide a shared-memory implementation of type-2 transforms
(interpolation).
As seen [below](@ref benchmarks-complex-type2), this can enable some minor gains
at large point densities.

[^1]: In fact the CuFINUFFT shared-memory implementation is surprisingly slow
    for the considered problem. It might perform better for two-dimensional or low-accuracy problems.

## [Real non-uniform data](@id benchmarks-real)

These tests are of interest for applications where **non-uniform data is
real-valued** (imaginary part is zero).
In NonuniformFFTs.jl, this enables the use of real-to-complex (type-1) and complex-to-real (type-2)
FFTs and also allows to halve the amount of data processed during the spreading
(type-1) and interpolation (type-2) procedures.
The benchmarks showcase the important gains which can be obtained by using real-data
transforms, which are not available in other libraries like FINUFFT or NFFT.jl.

In the plots below, the (Cu)FINUFFT curves are exactly the same as in the
[complex-data](@ref benchmarks-complex) benchmarks.

## FINUFFT set-up

We used FINUFFT via its Julia wrapper [FINUFFT.jl](https://github.com/ludvigak/FINUFFT.jl) v3.3.0. For
performance reasons, the (Cu)FINUFFT libraries were compiled locally and the
FINUFFT.jl sources were modified accordingly as described
[here](https://github.com/ludvigak/FINUFFT.jl?tab=readme-ov-file#advanced-installation-and-locally-compiling-binaries).
FINUFFT was compiled with GCC 10.2.0 using CMake with its default flags in `Release` mode, which include `-fPIC -funroll-loops -O3 -march=native`.
Moreover, we set `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=80` (for an NVIDIA A100) and used the `nvcc` compiler included in CUDA 12.3.

All FINUFFT benchmarks were run with relative tolerance `1e-6`.
Moreover, the following options were used:

- `modeord = 1` (use FFTW ordering, for consistency with NonuniformFFTs)
- `spread_sort = 1` (enable point sorting in CPU plans)
- `spread_kerevalmeth = 1` (use the recommended piecewise polynomial evaluation)
- `fftw = FFTW.ESTIMATE` (CPU plans)

and for GPU plans:

- `gpu_sort = 1` (enable point sorting)
- `gpu_kerevalmeth = 1` (use piecewise polynomial evaluation)
- `gpu_method = 1` (global memory method, "non-uniform points driven")

We also tried `gpu_method = 2` (open symbols, labelled SM) which seems to be
considerably slower in nearly all cases (in three dimensions, at the requested tolerance).
